# Tax Classifier

Ask the user to enter a salary amount.

- If the salary is < 50,000, output `Tax: 5 / 100 * salary`.

- Else, if the salary is less than 200,000, output `Tax: 10 / 100 * salary`.

- Else, output `Tax: 15 / 100 * salary`.

## Things to consider

Make sure that the amount entered is a positive number.
