# Attendance Register

Read student names, line by line, from a file.

For each name, ask if the student is in class.

E.g. `Is Bisi in class? [yes/no]`

Let the user input either `yes` or `no`.

## Sample txt file

```txt
Bisi
John
Davis
Kemi
Olaoluwa
```

## Variants

1. Store each name and entry in another txt file in the following format:

```txt
Bisi        ✅
John        ❌
Davis       ✅
Kemi        ✅
Olaoluwa    ❌
```

> Separate the name from the emoji with two tab spaces.
